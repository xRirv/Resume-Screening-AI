# AI-Powered Resume Screening & Candidate Ranking System 🚀

An AI-driven web application that helps recruiters automatically screen resumes and rank candidates based on how well their skills match a given job description.  
The system reduces manual effort, saves time, and supports fair, data-driven hiring decisions.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Recruiters often receive a large number of resumes for a single job opening.  
Manually reviewing each resume is:
- Time-consuming
- Prone to human bias
- Inefficient for bulk hiring

This project solves the problem by using AI to analyze resumes, extract skills, and rank candidates based on job relevance.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

The system allows recruiters to:
1. Enter job details (title, description, experience, location)
2. Upload multiple resumes (PDF / DOCX)
3. Automatically extract skills from resumes
4. Match candidate skills with job requirements
5. Rank candidates based on a match score
6. View results and make final decisions

AI is used only as a **decision-support tool** — final hiring decisions remain with humans.
